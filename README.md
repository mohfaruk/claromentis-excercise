## Junior Front End Code Task

The goal of this task is to implement the example of a page in the screen capture ([fig.1](#example---fig1)) as closely as you can using any tools/frameworks you choose, code the dropdown menu interaction using JavaScript (as shown in the screen capture - [fig.2](#dropdown-example---fig2)).

The starter project already contains:
  - the `index.html` file
  - the image assets required to complete the task

### Assessment Criteria

Submissions wil be assessed on:
