## Lessons Learned

This was an enjoyable excercise that gave me an opportunity to work on my front end skills using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used Bootstrap to help structure the cards accurately as per the examples provided on github. Bootstrap allowed me to add responsiveness to the design when accessing the project on smaller devices.

I placed badge icons on top off their respective backgrounds using CSS positioning which was great practice for me. Additionally, I used CSS styling to make adjustments to the elements margins/paddings.

I implemented functionality to the project with JavaScript using the click method to display a drop down menu when users click the button inside each card. The nextElementSibling method allowed me to do this without any errors when clicking on the button.

If I was to continue working on the project, I would add some functionaliy so users could delete/edit each badge icon or name. This would be excellent practice to apply my vanilla JavaScript skills.

## Junior Front End Code Task

The goal of this task is to implement the example of a page in the screen capture ([fig.1](#example---fig1)) as closely as you can using any tools/frameworks you choose, code the dropdown menu interaction using JavaScript (as shown in the screen capture - [fig.2](#dropdown-example---fig2)).

The starter project already contains:

- the `index.html` file
- the image assets required to complete the task

### Assessment Criteria

Please spend no more than 1-2 hours on the task.

Submissions wil be assessed on:

- Code quality, readability/clarity and reusability
- "Best practice" implementation
- Responsiveness (mobile/tablet friendly)

Don't worry if it's not fully complete by the end, we don't expect a pixel perfect recreation.
